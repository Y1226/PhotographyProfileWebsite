            <h1>Something about me</h1>
            <h3>I am going to write that I learned photography and took a course in 10th grade.
                I would like to take another course some day when I have time.
                Until then I am just practicing when I have an opportunity to do so. 
                Like for example now I do not have an opportunity to do so 
                because I have to do homework or help clean for pesach.
                But I hope that some day I will have the chance to continue developing my skills.<br>
                Do you want to hear/read more because I would love to tell you more, but lets assume you 
                don't want to hear anymore so I can stop writing.
